# WEBPACK_PROJECT

Readme for WEBPACK_PROJECT

## Getting Started

This project was cloned from zleinweb/webpack_starter which contains a minimal webpack configuration. After cloning from this template you will want to initialize your new project.

### Initialize

Run the initialize script:

```bash
./initialize.sh PROJECT_NAME
```

This script will:

- Search and replace WEBPACK_PROJECT with PROJECT_NAME in `README.md`, `package.json`, and `src/index.js`.

- Remove `package-lock.json` from `.gitignore`.

- Remove everything after "Getting Started" in the `README.md` (this file).

- Print some instructions detailing next steps (you should follow those).
